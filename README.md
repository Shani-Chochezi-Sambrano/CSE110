# CSE110

The educational app allows a high school algebra student to practice solving the slope intercept form y = m * x + b 
using randomly generated numbers.

Example interactions:

Given:
m = 10
x = 3
b = 2

What is the value of y? 32
Correct!

Given:

m = 6
x = 9
b = 3

What is the value of y? 52
Sorry, that is incorrect. The answer is 57.

There is a menu to allow for three modes of practice so that the student may solve for y, m, or b. 
The user is returned to the menu after each question.
